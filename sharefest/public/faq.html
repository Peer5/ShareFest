    <h3>What is this site?</h3>
    <p>
        Sharefest let's you send files, small or big, to other people.
    </p>

    <h3>How do I use Sharefest</h3>
    <p>
        You add files by clicking on the box or by dragging files into the box.
        Then you should see a link. This is a unique url for your files or "room".
        You can send this room URL through social networks, mail or just manually by copy&paste.
    </p>

    <h3>What is room?</h3>
    A room is a place on Sharefest with a unique URL, that people
    can enter and start downloading specific files. This files are
    currently added by the room creator.
    A room has a swarm of peers that are connected in a <a href="#swarming">mesh network</a>
    For example room "ec90ce95" can be found on <a href="https://www.sharefest.me/ec90ce95">http://www.sharefest.me/b909410e</a>
    </p>

    <h3>Can't I use Gmail for that?</h3>
    <p>
        Sometimes. Gmail is limited for 25MB, and is not designed primarily for sending files.
        You also need the recipients email addresses.
    </p>

    <h3>Why is it different from services such as Dropbox and Yousendit?</h3>
    <p>
        Sharefest does not use cloud storage. These services work by uploading and storing
        the files in a remote storage, owned by these companies. Then recipients can download
        it from the servers. In Sharefest, the files are downloaded from other browsers, peer-2-peer.
    </p>

    <h3>Sound like BitTorrent. Why should I use Sharefest?</h3>
    <p>BitTorrent is great, but requires a special software to be downloaded. <br>
       We wanted to build a web-based platform for filesharing that everyone with a modern browser
        could use. <br>
        Our goal is that everyone could just enter a Sharefest URL and start downloading, even our parents :)
    </p>

    <h3>Do you use Flash or any other plugin for the P2P</h3>
    <p>
        No - Only HTML+JS+CSS.
    </p>
    <h3>How is it even possible? I thought P2P cannot happen unless a plugin is used</h3>
    <p>
        This was true up until recently. <br>Now there is a new HTML5 standard called <a href="http://webrtc.org">WebRTC</a>
        and it has an API to transfer arbitrary data - Data Channels API (or <a href="http://updates.html5rocks.com/2013/02/WebRTC-data-channels-API-changes-and-Chrome-talks-to-Firefox">RTCDataChannels API</a>).
    </p>

    <h3>Who can see my files?</h3>

    <h3>What encryption is used?</h3>

    <h3>What browsers are supported?</h3>
    <p>
        Currently Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox.
    </p>

    <h3>do I have to open my ports for that?</h3>
    <p>
        Usually no. Sharefest use standard WebRTC NAT traversal protocol - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STUN">STUN</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>
        What is a seeder?
    </h3>
    <p>
        A peer (user) that have the complete file and serve it to other peers.
    </p>

    <h3>
        When can I close the tab?
    </h3>
    <p>
        The notification bar on the top of the box helps you to determine that.
        If you are the only seeder of the file, you want to make sure the file is available.
        Once more people seed, it is safe to close (you will see a green bar).
    </p>

    <h3 id="swarming">What are swarm and mesh network?</h3>
    <p>

    </p>

    <h3>Why is this “a firefox swarm”/”chrome swarm” ?</h3>
    <p>Right now, Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox cannot send data between each other. Sad but true</p>

    <h3>Why is the in alpha? When Sharefest is going to be beta and stable?</h3>
    <h3>
        I drag a file to sharefest but I don’t get a link
    </h3>

    <h3>
        I’m kicking back and relaxing but I don’t get the file
    </h3>

    <h3>I have some ideas how to improve Sharefest, who should I talk to?</h3>
    <h3>How can I help?</h3>
     <h3>Who is behind this project?</h3>
    <h3>Why do you have such an ugly logo?</h3>
    <p>Because we are not designers. You are welcome to submit a new one.
        We do love our icon though</p>

    <h3 id="spaceLimit">Why do I get a "Not enough disk space to download this file" message?</h3>
    <p>To support the delivery of large files Sharefest uses HTML5 FileSystem API for storing the file temporarily in your browser.
       This API is supported only by Chrome and it won't work in incognito mode.
        It only works if you have enough space on your disk for us to use. More precisely Chrome let us use up to 10% of your free disk space. This means that if you'd like to download or share a big file you'll have to have 10x free space than the file size.
        <a href=https://developers.google.com/chrome/whitepapers/storage>Would you like to know more?</a>.

    <h3>What is this weird icon?</h3>
    <p>No one knows. Some think it's a happy, festing star.<br>
       Other claim it's actually a smashed rubber on the wall.
